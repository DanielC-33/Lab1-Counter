To find which port the vbuddy is connected to, go to /dev.

Then run:

` ls tty `

+TAB at the end

I deleted the vbuddy.cfg file provided that contained a different dir for the vbuddy.

vbuddy.cpp contains all of the functions that can be run on the vbuddy. The descriptions describe what they do.
How they work can be found by looking at references or towards the end of the cpp file.
